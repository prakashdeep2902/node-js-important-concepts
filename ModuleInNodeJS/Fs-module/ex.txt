The company was founded in 2013 by Indian Institute of Technology alumni Akhil Gupta, Amit Kumar Agarwal, and Saurabh Garg as a real estate search portal directly connecting flat owners and tenants. In October 2015, the company expanded its operations to include the resale of properties.[2] In November 2021, it became 36th unicorn in India for that year.[3]

NoBroker's broker-free operation is based on consumer-to-consumer (C2C) marketplace model.[4] Unlike a business-to-consumer (B2C) model where brokers contribute supply and the startup focuses on demand, a C2C approach necessitates the company to handle both supply and demand.[5] The company's C2C model employs a proprietary property discovery algorithm, considering commute and livability scores, along with property features. A machine learning algorithm then determines the suitable rental amount based on listing attributes, livability score, and historical data.[6]

As of 2022, the company clocks more than 5 00,000 transactions yearly, and more than 75 lakh properties are registered on the portal.[3] Currently, the company's services are available in Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Chennai, Delhi National Capital Region, Hyderabad, Mumbai, and Pune
